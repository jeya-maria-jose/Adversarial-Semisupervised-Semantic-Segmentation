# [Adversarial Learning For Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=HkTgsG-CW "Open Review")
## Introduction
The central theme of the work by the authors is to incorporate adversarial training for semantic-segmentation task which enables the segmentation-network to learn in a semi-supervised fashion on top of the traditional supervised learning. The authors claim significant improvement in the performance (measured in terms of mean IoU) of segmentation network after the supervised-training is extended with adversarial and semi-supervised training.


## Results produced

A accuracy difference of 5 to 10 percentage when compared to the normal base segmentation architecture.
